# Call for Speakers

We host meetups each month in downtown SF and in South Bay quarterly. Anyone can submit a talk! We are always looking for new presenters and presentations.

You don't have to have any experience speaking, just love sharing your experience or knowledge with the community and practice public speaking skills.

## How it works

- Read the guidelines below.
- Submit a proposal via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/JAMStackSF/JAMStackSF/issues/new) or contact the organizers on Slack (https://jamstack.org/slack) in the #meetup-sfbayarea slack channel. You can find an example of a talk submission from the first issue on the list.
- If you know you want to do a quicker presentation (~10 min) then add a _Lightning!_ tag to the issue.
- If the proposal sounds like something that will work for our members, we'll group the talk with similar proposals and schedule it.
